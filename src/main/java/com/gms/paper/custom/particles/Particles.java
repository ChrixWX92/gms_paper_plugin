    SPLASHPOTIONSPELL, // Black, slow spreading
    HUGE_EXPLOSION_LAB_MISC, // Very large, grey explosion cloud
    DRAGON_DESTROY_BLOCK, // Denser, faster explosion
    STUNNED, // Sparse, levitating grey spirals; lasts indefinitely
    SPORE_BLOSSOM_SHOWER, // Semi-long, sparse, dripping green
    FALLING_DUST_TOP_SNOW, // Quick, pretty, semi-sparse, white, falling snow
    EVOKER_SPELL, // Indefinite, radiating black swirls, dense
    ARROWSPELL, // Small, quick grey swirls coming forth
    HUGE_EXPLOSION_LEVEL, // Maybe slightly smaller than HUGE_EXPLOSION_LAB_MISC
    WATER_SPLASH, // Very short, sparse blue drops, use multiple times
    LAVA_DRIP, // Slow, single lava drop
    FALLING_BORDER_DUST, // Slow, single red star, varying sizes, pretty, should be used multiple times
    RISING_BORDER_DUST, // See above
    BLUE_FLAME, // Single, small soul fire flame
    FALLING_DUST_RED_SAND, // Like FALLING_BORDER_DUST, but earthy orange, less star-shaped
    EXPLOSION_EYEOFENDER_DEATH, // Fast, dynamic purple swirls outwards, would be cool if used multiple times
    MAGNESIUM_SALTS, // Elegant, rising white swirl, would suit being used multiple times
    SPARKLER, // Black to white colour shifting small falling star
    ELECTRIC_SPARK, // Very fast, medium, random direction moving white star
    BASIC_PORTAL, // Small, slowly falling purple particle
    END_CHEST, // Small, semi-slow, radiating purple particles
    EVOCATION_FANG, // Fairly dramatic, but quick falling single spikey star
    MOBSPELL, // Rising, monochrome shifting swirl
    OBSIDIAN_TEAR, // As you'd expect, single, purple drop - lasts a while
    CONDUIT, // Very slight, random colour, static particle (use multiple times for any decent result)
    EXPLOSION_EGG_DESTROY, // Very cool, fairly large, white, fluffy rising plume
    ENCHANTING_TABLE_PARTICLE, // Elegant, but slight, radiating single white particle
    SNOWFLAKE, // As you'd expect, good size, but quick
    TOTEM, // Extremely cool, expanding, green, large, splotchy explosion
    DRAGON_BREATH_FIRE, // Cool, descending, then ascending and growing purple particle
    WATER_EVAPORATION_MANUAL, // Nice, effective, white expanding, medium-sized cloud
    WATER_EVAPORATION_BUCKET, // Like above, but perhaps even more effective
    PORTAL_DIRECTIONAL, // See BASIC_PORTAL, but add a black particle, moving randomly
    SILVERFISH_GRIEF, // Another nice, radiating, small/medium steamy explosion, unfolds slowly but elegantly, coords will need to be specific
    MOBFLAME_SINGLE, // A single, but decently sized flame, 1-2 secs
    MOBFLAME, // The above, but seems to last indefinitely
    DRIPSTONE_WATER_DRIP, // Single water drip, as you'd expect, slow
    DRIPSTONE_LAVA_DRIP, // The above, but lava - even slower
    CAMERA_SHOOT_EXPLOSION, // Perfect, medium-sized grey/white explosion
    SOUL, // Small, but elegant light-blue plume, use multiple times to great effect
    LLAMA_SPIT, // Modest, but effective, rising white plume
    WATER_WAKE, // Tiny, semi-slow, rising, water-coloured plume
    FALLING_DUST_SCAFFOLDING, // Like FALLING_DUST_RED_SAND, but very washed out yellow, quite nice if used multiple times
    REDSTONE_WIRE_DUST, // A familiar sight, slowly evaporating, small-medium radiating scarlet plume - will look great with multiple uses
    HEART, // Decent-sized, rising, red love heart
    CONDUIT_ATTACK, // Like CONDUIT, but two particle colours together, seems to last longer too
    ENDROD, // Very slow, falling, medium-small, white orb decays to star
    WITHER_BOSS_INVULNERABLE, // Single black swirl radiates randomly away, medium-long
    EXPLOSION_DEATH, // Like SILVERFISH_GRIEF, but a tiny bit bigger/longer
    CAMPFIRE_SMOKE, // Good sized, dark grey rising cloud(s), pretty cool
    COLORED_FLAME, // Single, diminishing flame (random colour?)
    EXPLOSION_LABTABLE_FIRE, // Single, fairly small, white/grey smoke plume, a nice subtle one
    HONEY_DRIP, // As you'd expect, but ever so slightly greener - single fallen drip sticks around for a long while
    CANDLE_FLAME, // Single, diminishing, small, but ordinary flame; very long
    LAB_TABLE_MISC_MYSTICAL, // Barely discernible, single falling drop - almost looks transparent
    MOB_BLOCK_SPAWN, // Another generic, rising explosion/white smoke cloud, not bad
    BASIC_SMOKE, // Dark grey, rising single smoke particle, would be very effective with multiple uses
    BASIC_CRIT, // Grey/orange crit star, falling fairly fast
    VILLAGER_ANGRY, // Single, rising fire and smoke combined particle, small-medium, looks a little like a fire charge, could be quite effective with multiple uses
    VILLAGER_HAPPY, // Green, static star
    NOTE, // Very fast, black, rising, music note
    DRAGON_DEATH_EXPLOSION, // Fast, but very large, single, grey explosion
    MYCELIUM_DUST, // Tiny, grey, static particle
    PORTAL_REVERSE, // Very nice, small, bubbling purple plumes, decent length
    FALLING_DUST, // Basically the same as FALLING_DUST_SCAFFOLDING, but very dark grey
    LAVA_PARTICLE, // Cool, spitting single lava and smoke particle, will look awesome if used multiple times
    SHULKER_BULLET, // Almost identical to ENDROD
    BALLOON_GAS, // ENDROD, but static and faster
